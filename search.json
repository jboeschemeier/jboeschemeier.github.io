In practice, prices are typically aggregated into large zones with spatially uniform prices. This paper develops an empirical framework to quantify the welfare loss of zonal pricing and to design welfare-improving price zones. We propose the spatial R-squared as a measure of spatial market efficiency and show that economically motivated clustering methods recover efficiency-maximizing zones. Applying the framework to three U.S. wholesale electricity markets, we demonstrate its computational tractability and find that existing zones are misaligned with current network conditions.\n\n\nDesigning Hedging Instruments for Locational Price Risks – Lessons from North America       with Leon Stolle, Benjamin F. Hobbs, Karsten Neuhoff\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nLocational marginal pricing (LMP), or nodal pricing, provides efficient locational dispatch signals but requires a complementary congestion hedging instrument to function effectively. This project investigates how exposure to locational price differences is managed in North American nodal electricity markets through the implementation of Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). Drawing on insights from 15 industry experts directly involved across all major North American electricity markets, we consolidate first-hand perspectives that reveal the practical complexities of FTR design and implementation. While most interviewees view FTRs positively, their experiences uncover multiple nuanced challenges to successfully design locational hedging instruments, which are often overlooked in the academic literature. As FTR design depends on market characteristics, we apply the findings to the European electricity market and discuss implications for an implementation of LMP in Europe."
