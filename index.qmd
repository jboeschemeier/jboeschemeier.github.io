I am a PhD candidate in Energy Economics at the <a href="https://www.ep.mgt.tum.de/cem/home/" target="_blank">Center for Energy Markets</a> at the <a href="https://www.mgt.tum.de/" target="_blank">Technical University of Munich</a>. I study the role of power market design in the energy transition with a primary focus on locational and real-time pricing. Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree at <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/" target="_blank">Maastricht University</a> and an MPhil in Economics at the <a href="https://tinbergen.nl/" target="_blank">Tinbergen Institute</a> in Amsterdam.

Overall, my research interests lie in the field of empirical IO applied to energy and environmental economics. Other interests include industrial decarbonisation, climate policy and international economics.
